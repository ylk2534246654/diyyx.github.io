You no-longer have to be content with basic cookie-cutter rocket engine variants, you can build your own with the eight new engine types, seven new nozzles, and six new fuel types that are available which allows for hundreds of possible rocket engine configurations. They also have slider options for size, nozzle length, throat radius, and chamber pressure so really there are infinite possible configurations.

Pro Tip: If you already own SimplePlanes on Steam, you can get SimpleRockets 2 with an additional 15% discount if you complete the Aerospace Engineer Bundle.</Notification>
